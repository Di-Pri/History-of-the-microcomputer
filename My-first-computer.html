    <main>
      <h2>1989</h2>
      <p>
        I started using a computer when I was three years old. Computers were so new at that time. They were expensive and hard to find. I
        remember it as a simple keyboard, but it was a Soviet microcomputer "Partner 01.01".
      </p>
      <h2>Software of the Partner 01.01</h2>
      <p>
        The ROM of the "Partner 01.01" contained the Monitor operating system, a
        <abbr title="Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</abbr> interpreter, and a simple text editor with Assembler.
        Along with the computer, software was delivered on cassettes - BASIC, Assembler, Forth.

        <h2>My experience of using the computer</h2>
        <h3>Playing games</h3>
        <p>
          As a three-year-old child, my first interaction with the computer was randomly pressing buttons. Then I started to play the games
          "Snake" and "Tetris". Since computers were scarce at the time, friends would come over to play games with me. Later I tried to
          type some text.
        </p>
        <h3>Writing programs</h3>
        <p>
          Later my father and I wrote a program with BASIC language. My father told me that he found a description of a code in the magazine
          "Radio", and that I helped him to type some numbers and letters. He said it was a complicated process, but in the end, it worked.
          We had to save the created program on a cassette tape, otherwise it would be lost when we switched off the computer. Each time we
          wanted to play a game, we had to load it.
        </p>

      <h2>Next computer I had was different</h2>
      <p>
        The next computer we had at home resembled a contemporary computer. It consisted of a separate computer case, a huge display, a
        keyboard, and a mouse. The most important part is that the computer had access to the Internet, although it was expensive and I was
        allowed to use it just occasionally.

      <h2>Specifications of the Partner 01.01</h2>
      <p>
        The computer had been produced since 1987. It was made in the form of a monoblock, which housed a power supply, keyboard, and
        motherboard with a central processor KR580VM80A, a clone of the Intel 8080 CPU.
      </p>
      <p>This model was distinguished by significantly expanded RAM - 64 Kbytes and ROM - 16 Kbytes.</p>
      <p>
        Its main feature was the presence of four special slots for modules in the form of cartridges, designed to expand the computer's
        functionality. Four extra modules could be connected to the computer as an additional expander.
      </p>
      <p>
        It weighed almost four kilograms and consumed 22 watts. An ordinary TV was used as an output device. For external storage we used a
        household cassette tape recorder.
